# FontinaTP: Fontina Transfer Protocol, a Python program for transferring files.
FontinaTP is a program written in Python that allows two clients behinds firewalls with NAT to exchange files directly, without needing to use a cloud file storage service. FontinaTP uses a technique knows as *TCP Hole Punching* which uses an intermediate server to create a "tunnel" between the two clients. This technique allows to bypass the limitations imposed by the firewall, and to exchange data directly. 

> The name "FontinaTP" is a play on words between FTP, the File Transfer Protocol, and Fontina, the swiss cheese with holes. Since this program is used to exchange files, like FTP, and creates "holes" in the firewall, like Fontina, the name FontinaTP sounded fitting.
# Getting Started
To do. The project it's still in its early stages and no functioning build is yet available.
