# FontinaTP: Fontina Transfer Protocol, a Python program for transferring files.
FontinaTP is a program written in Python that allows two clients behinds firewalls with NAT to exchange files directly, without needing to use a cloud file storage service. FontinaTP uses a technique knows as *TCP Hole Punching* which uses an intermediate server to create a "tunnel" between the two clients. This technique allows to bypass the limitations imposed by the firewall, and to exchange data directly. 

> The name "FontinaTP" is a play on words between FTP, the File Transfer Protocol, and Fontina, the italian cheese with holes, since the program exchanges file by punching holes into the firewall. As it turns out, Fontina doesn't have many holes, but the name stuck anyways because it sounded funny when I first came up with it.

# Planned Functions and Roadmap
What follows is a *sort of* comprehensive list of all feature that will be implementend in FontinaTP. This list is subject to change at any time, since new idea will inevitably come up during development.
- Nice CLI interface for ease of use :hammer_and_wrench:
- Connection handling to Nexus Server (NXS) :hammer_and_wrench:
- TCP Hole Punching procedure :x:
- File selection screen :x:
- File exchange procedure :x:
- Cool chiptune theme :x:

# Getting Started
To do. The project it's still in its early stages and no functioning build is yet available.
